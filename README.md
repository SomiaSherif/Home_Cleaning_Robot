# Home Cleaning Robot using Computer Vision

•	Designed and built a home-cleaning robot prototype using:                                                                                                                     

      1-	Arduino microcontroller to control the movements of the robot           
      
      2-	Ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles
      
      3-	HC-05 Bluetooth module for the communication between the robot and the machine-learning model.
      
      4-	Camera for object detection.

•	Implemented the VGG16 model and OpenCV library for image classification, training it on a recycling waste dataset that contains 9 classes (paper – e-waste – glass   – clothes – batteries – metal – organic – plastic – light bulbs) to detect paper waste.

•	Programmed the robot to open a fan if paper waste was detected using the VGG16 model, and to close the fan if other waste was detected.

•	Presented the robot at the CDIS event
